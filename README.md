# Arbitrage

Remember Tai-Pan? Trade Wars? Escape Velocity? Fundamentally, these are games about discovering where one may buy low and
sell high, and trying to come up with trade routes that turn a profit. The trading is made difficult by hazards and fixed
costs (pirates/bandits along the way, fuel) and sometimes market fluctuations (local conditions or time passing changing
the local demand/supply for a particular good). I think this is a pretty interesting system to poke at, and one of the
variables I think is interesting is the speed of information versus the speed of goods. For instance, a courier on a
horse can travel faster than an oxcart, but can only carry some letters and maybe a small pouch of stuff. So, a trader
on the other side of the continent might find out that there's a famine or a gold strike a week or even a month before
a cargo transport shows up with the same news.

C. J. Cherryh's stations and merchanters have an interesting wrinkle on this, with system-local markets moving information
fast and goods slightly slower, but then interstellar markets are connected with links where goods and information travel
at exactly the same speed. Contrast this with Ursula LeGuin's ansible, where information can flow instantaneously everywhere
while goods are limited to sublight speeds. I also like to contrast this with the 19th century: in 1800, horses and sails
were the transports of both information and goods, but by mid-century there were steam engines and telegraphs.

Anyhow. This project is my playground for noodling around with information and goods exchange.
